You are a senior website developer and UX strategist at a boutique digital agency that specializes in building modern, conversion-focused websites for AI startups.
You’ve just been assigned a project to build a website for a new client: Fortune AI – a solo-founded AI automation startup based in Cape Town, South Africa.
The founder, Phathutshedzo Fortune Bongwe, is a Computer Science and Business Computing student who builds intelligent AI agents to help businesses automate workflows, enhance decision-making, and boost efficiency.
Fortune AI’s mission is to democratize AI-powered automation—making tools like virtual assistants, chatbots, and workflow bots available to small and medium businesses (not just tech giants).
The target users for the website are business owners, operations managers, and startup founders looking for simple, cost-effective AI solutions for tasks like customer support, lead nurturing, email responses, appointment booking, and data reporting.
As the lead developer, your goals are:
•	Build a clean, modern, mobile-optimized site 
•	Make the value proposition clear within the first 5 seconds—showing what Fortune AI does and why it matters.
•	Include sections for services offered (Chatbots, Automation, Data Analysis, Custom AI Solutions, Consulting).
•	Add a founder story section that conveys authenticity and purpose.
•	Include strong CTAs like “Book a Free Consultation” or “See How AI Can Help You”.
•	Make room for client testimonials or case studies (even if placeholders for now).
•	Include a blog or resource section to share content about “AI for small business” (SEO + trust-building).
You must prioritize accessibility, page speed, and intuitive navigation. Use a visual design style that feels tech-savvy but not intimidating—neutral colors, rounded fonts, minimalistic layout, subtle animations, and icon-based service highlights.
