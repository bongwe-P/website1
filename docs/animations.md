1. Page-Level & Global Animations
Preloader Overlay
A simple animated SVG or Lottie spinner (or your logo morphing) that fades out when the site’s assets finish loading.

Cursor Effects

Custom Cursor: Replace the native cursor with a glowing dot or small ring that trails behind slightl y.

Cursor-Hover Repel/Attract: Elements (icons/buttons) can “jiggle” or “pulse” when the cursor nears them.

Scroll Progress Bar
A thin gradient bar at the very top of the viewport that fills from 0→100% as the user scrolls.

Page Transitions
Use a quick full-screen fade/slide or “liquid” mask wipe when navigating between internal pages.

2. Hero & Above-the-Fold
Particle or Noise Background
Subtle, moving particles or a “digital noise” layer over your gradient—parallax-driven so it shifts with mouse movement.

Headline Reveal

Typewriter Effect: Animate the heading text letter-by-letter on load.

Clip-Path Unveil: A sliding mask that “wipes” the headline into view.

CTA Button

Glow Pulse: A slow, rhythmic neon glow that loops.

Micro-bounce: On hover, the button bounces upward 2–3px before settling.

3D/Canvas Animation
If you have a product model or abstract shape, animate it in WebGL (Three.js) or with a Lottie JSON so it rotates, pulses, or responds to cursor movement.

3. Micro-Interactions (Hover/Click)
Icons & SVGs

Stroke Draw: On hover, draw the icon’s outline with a stroke-dashoffset animation.

Fill-Fade: Fill icons from 0→100% opacity.

Links & Text Underlines

Sliding Underline: A thin accent bar slides in from left to right on hover.

Letter-Spacing: Letters expand outwards slightly.

Form Inputs & Buttons

Input Focus Glow: A neon-blue border glow that softly pulses.

Submit Button: On click, transition into a circle spinner then morph back to the button.

4. Scroll-Triggered & In-View
Section Fade/Slide
As each major section enters the viewport, fade up from 20px below + fade-in over 0.6s.

Staggered Children Animations
Within a grid (e.g., feature cards), each card animates in 0.1s after the previous one for a cascading effect.

Parallax Layers
Background gradient layer moves at 80% scroll speed, midground content at 100%, and foreground accent shapes at 120%.

Image Tilt & Reveal
Images tilt slightly on scroll into view, then settle to flat; or mask-reveal via an SVG clip-path.

Number Counters
Animated count from 0→target (e.g., “1,200+ customers”) when scrolled into view.

5. Component-Specific Animations
Component	Animation
Feature Cards	Lift + shadow intensify + icon pulse every 3s
Testimonial Slides	Fade + scale (0.9→1) + auto-rotate every 5s (hover to pause)
Pricing Table	On hover, the selected plan card expands 5% and accent border glows
Navigation Menu	Hamburger → close icon morph; menu items stagger-fade on open
Modals/Popups	Scale from 0.8→1 + opacity 0→1; backdrop blur animates from 0→8px
Tooltips	Fade-in + slide from top; small bounce on appear

6. Background & Gradient Animations
Animated Gradient CSS

```css
@keyframes gradientShift {
  0%   { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50%  { background-position: 100% 50%; }
  100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
}
body {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7F00FF, #1F1F2E, #00CFFD);
  background-size: 300% 300%;
  animation: gradientShift 15s ease infinite;
}
```

Hover-Triggered Glow
A second, slightly faster animation that only kicks in on :hover, boosting brightness and contrast.

SVG Shape Animations
Flowing, morphing blobs or low-poly shapes drifting very slowly in the background.
